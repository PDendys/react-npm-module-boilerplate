# React NPM Module Boilerplate
Having a clear, thorough, and helpful readme can make a huge differce in your components usage. Keep in mind that this is what is display on npm for how to use your component. You don't need a readme to publish. Just keep in mind that if you're making the readme a separate task, it will require its own publish event. (which isn't hard).

# API
#### Import
It can be helpful to leave a copy/paste example of an import.
Like:
```import { SuperCoolComponent } from 'your-cool-component';```
#### Props
Make sure to list all the props your component can take and what the defaults are!

# Examples
Document some usage examples. When I did my first, I showed how I was using it and what my use case was.
